## Information on Computing dv/v
To compute dv/v, Peter uses SeisMIC (the code he's written). Head to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PeterMakus/SeisMIC) and the [documentation](https://petermakus.github.io/SeisMIC/) for information on installation and how to use. You can also ask me, whenever something comes up (or open an issue in said repository).
